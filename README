This is the standard kexec-tools master branch, except I had to modify 
to just return 0 for the time being, until I find a way to reimplement the 
functionality using only libs from the 2.6.39 motorola droidX/droid2 kernel.

===========
BUILDING
===========

You *must* use bash, and not zsh or any other shell!

To build, edit envsetup.sh to point to your compiled kernel sources and
Android NDK directory. Then, run envsetup.sh and make. You'll then have
a nice, fresh kexec_load.ko file as the output.

./bootstrap
./envsetup.sh

(modify the below to suit your needs)

LDFLAGS=-static ./configure \
--host=arm CC=/opt/android-ndk/toolchains/arm-linux-androideabi-4.4.3/prebuilt/linux-x86/bin/arm-linux-androideabi-gcc \
CFLAGS=--sysroot=/opt/android-ndk/platforms/android-8/arch-arm/ \
CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/android-ndk/platforms/android-8/arch-arm/ \
LDFLAGS=--sysroot=/opt/android-ndk/platforms/android-8/arch-arm/

make
