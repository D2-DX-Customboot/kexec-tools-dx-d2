This is the standard kexec-tools master branch, except I had to modify 
to just return 0 for the time being, until I find a way to reimplement the 
functionality using only libs from the 2.6.39 motorola droidX/droid2 kernel.

===========
BUILDING
===========

You *must* use bash, and not zsh or any other shell!

To build, edit envsetup.sh to point to your compiled kernel sources and
Android NDK directory.

./bootstrap
./envsetup.sh

(modify the below to suit your needs)

LDFLAGS=-static ./configure \
--host=arm CC=/opt/android-ndk/toolchains/arm-linux-androideabi-4.4.3/prebuilt/linux-x86/bin/arm-linux-androideabi-gcc \
CFLAGS=--sysroot=/opt/android-ndk/platforms/android-8/arch-arm/ \
CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/android-ndk/platforms/android-8/arch-arm/ \
LDFLAGS=--sysroot=/opt/android-ndk/platforms/android-8/arch-arm/

make

Then, copy the binaries from /build/sbin/* to your device, and the move them to the /system/bin directory, and chmod them 770 to make them executable.
